# XDataFrame
Java library for using DataFrame structure type and functions like python:pandas and machine learning algorithms like python:sklearn. You can use this library for creating machine learning models and also data science.

<h5>I created DataFrame data structure on this project like pandas you can read data from csv files text files etc. or you can reshape your 2d arrays to dataframe(all types of arrays can reshape). And so many data manipulation and examine functions exists in it.</h5>
